# GeometricAlgebra
*Mathematica* package for Clifford (geometric) algebra calculations
~Version (2024-06-14)~  


**Quick startup**
1. Unzip the content preserving directory structure
2. Open GA.nb and follow setup & configuration instructions in the beginning of the notebook. 
3. Open UsageExamples/01_Start.nb notebook and try to repeat calculations.

**Main features**
- Textbook notation and precedences of products (without Mathematica palettes)
- Algebraic operations in orthonormal frame (additive representation, symbolic coefficients)
- Multiple algebras in the same Mathematica session
- Matrix representations of Cl(p,q) algebras (two algorithms)
- Idempotents with different basis sorting
- Main involutions and general multivector inverse
- Algebraic (ideal) and operator (Hestenes) spinors (not finished)
- Series of elementary functions of Cl(p,q) (one MV argument functions only) 
- Functions for MV (arbitrary Cl(p,q) algebras) 
- Sorting/ordering of general MV
- Transformation and AdjointTranformation for linear transformations
- Clifford calculus (directional and vector derivatives) in arbitrary signature flat space

**Short file description**
- GA.nb (main file, contains installation information)
- UnicodeCharactersAdd.tr (add-on for Mathematica system file for Linux and Mac)
- UnicodeCharactersAddWin10.tr (add-on for Mathematica system file for Windows)
