0.1.0.0 (2016.09.20) 
initial commit

0.1.0.1 (2016.09.23)
fix small MakeExpression bug
optimize gaProductExpand and GeometricProduct 
much clear setup and configuration instructions
some small corrections in examples notebooks

0.1.0.2 (2016.10.18)
Fix base element alias input bug when gaRunning algebra set to tensor product
enhance gaProductExpand 
new example notebook 03a_Blades.nb
corrections in other examples notebooks to meet the changes

0.1.0.3 (2016.11.08)
Critical geometric product expansion function is completely rewritten. It is now 
much faster (especially for longer symbolic multivectors).

0.1.0.4 (2016.12.22)
New example notebook 04a_MultivectorInverse.nb. 
Tiny enhancment/bugfix of gaGetMV and gaGetGrade.
Setup and configuration clarifications. 

0.2.x.x (2019.07.01)
This is forced prerelease to support our recently submitted article about square roots.
The package itself is working, however, the examples are not consistent
(contains old syntax, old names of commands, etc). Wait till end of the year
for fully consistent 0.2 release. 

0.2 (2019.10.22)
Many new features: faster product multiplication, gaSqrt function for n=3 algebras, 
more or less working sorting of MV, many small changes and bug fixes. All example files
were recomputed and now should work with the package version. 

0.2.0.1 (2019.10.31)
New example notebook about computation of algebraic spinors included. Expansion method 
defaulted back to "RealTimePairProduct", since the new method has problems when coefficients are
quaternions (problem with gaGetMVComponents[ ]).

0.2.0.x (2020.08.01) Preliminary commit for ICCA12, some of examples requires modifications and may not work.

0.2.0.9 (2021.02.17) New implementation of sqrt function of MV for n<=3 allows symbolic
inputs. Exponents (exact formulas) for MV of algebras n<=3 were implemented.
New option handling, user more friendly bad option detection/suggestion
mechanism mostly implemented. Many small improvements/bug fixes.

0.2.1.9 (2021.12.07) Exact formulas for elementary functions (sqrt, Exp, Log, hyperbolic, trigonometric (when exist)
 and their inverses for algebras n<=3 were implemented. Many small improvements/bug fixes. 
Example on computing adjoint transformations included. Conference oriented notebooks removed.

0.2.4 (2022.06.10) Exact formulas for most of elementary and special functions  for arbitrary(!) algebras were implemented for diagonalizable MV using novel spectral decomposition formulas.
Example notebook on functions was significantly extended. Number of commands renamed, some obsotete/rarely used functions moved to obsolete.nb (which have to be run separately). 
Option handling improved (still not very convenient). Many other smaller changes and bug fixes.

0.2.5 (2023.04.01) Start of implementation of Clifford algebra on tangent space. At the moment one can set the coordinate system, multiply basis elements and compute very limited set of properties. 
Many bug fixes: in particular correction of Log for Cl(3,0) for one very specific case. Few new small functions.


(2023.04.23) Further development of derivative operators. This part is yet to change significantly. Many bugs expected

(2023.06.19) Linking to notebooks was made working under user request. Many bugs expected.

(2023.12.22) Half year progress update. Now $Pre is clear and all input cheking is implemented in $Preread alone. Directional and vector derivatives functions acting in Cartessian arbitrary signature sapce now are rather well tested. Many small fixes.
