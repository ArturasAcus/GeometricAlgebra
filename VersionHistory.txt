0.1.0.0 (2016.09.20) 
initial commit

0.1.0.1 (2016.09.23)
fix small MakeExpression bug
optimize gaProductExpand and GeometricProduct 
much clear setup and configuration instructions
some small corrections in examples notebooks

0.1.0.2 (2016.10.18)
Fix base element alias input bug when gaRunning algebra set to tensor product
enhance gaProductExpand 
new example notebook 03a_Blades.nb
corrections in other examples notebooks to meet the changes

0.1.0.3 (2016.11.08)
Critical geometric product expansion function is completely rewritten. It is now 
much faster (especially for longer symbolic multivectors).

0.1.0.4 (2016.12.22)
New example notebook 04a_MultivectorInverse.nb. 
Tiny enhancment/bugfix of gaGetMV and gaGetGrade.
Setup and configuration clarifications. 

0.2.x.x (2019.07.01)
This is forced prerelease to support our recently submitted article about square roots.
The package itself is working, however, the examples are not consistent
(contains old syntax, old names of commands, etc). Wait till end of the year
for fully consistent 0.2 release. 

0.2 (2019.10.22)
Many new features: faster product multiplication, gaSqrt function for n=3 algebras, 
more or less working sorting of MV, many small changes and bug fixes. All example files
were recomputed and now should work with the package version. 

0.2.0.1 (2019.10.31)
New example notebook about computation of algebraic spinors included. Expansion method 
defaulted back to "RealTimePairProduct", since the new method has problems when coefficients are
quaternions (problem with gaGetMVComponents[ ]).
